# Lint to the Future ðŸš€

LintToTheFuture is a modern way to progressively update your entire codebase to the latest best practices. It has a number of tools that work together to manage linting rules and provides a sustainable way to add new rules to existing codebases without slowing down your development

## Installation

You should install this as a dev-dependency of your project

```
npm i --save-dev lint-to-the-future
```

on its own LintToTheFuture doesn't do anything by itself, you should also install some plugins. The first plugin written for LintToTheFuture was the eslint plugin which you can install using the following:

```
npm i --save-dev lint-to-the-future-eslint
```

### Plugins

LintToTheFuture will automatically load each plugin (any package you have installed locally starting with `lint-to-the-future-`) and run them in order.

You can write your own plugin, or use one from the existing list:
- For Ember apps: [`lint-to-the-future-ember-template`](https://github.com/mansona/lint-to-the-future-ember-template)
- For all JavaScript apps: [`lint-to-the-future-eslint`](https://github.com/mansona/lint-to-the-future-eslint)

## Usage

This project is still in alpha phase, so we will add new sub-sections to Usage as they have been implemented. If you are interested in this project feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at [@real_ate](https://twitter.com/real_ate).

### Adding file-based lint ignores to your project

Using the `eslint` plugin as an example: running the cli application will automatically run `eslint` on your codebase and add file-based ignores to that file.

```
npx lint-to-the-future ignore
```

After running this process you should be able to run `eslint` on your project again and it will show no more errors.

**Note:** we don't currently add file-based ignores for warnings as they don't generally break CI in the most common configurations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do you use file based ignores instead of line-based or projected-wide

The point of LintToTheFuture is to allow you to **progressively** update your codebase using new lint rules without overwhelming you with the task. You can easily ignore lint rules using project-based ignores in your config files but that doesn't prevent you from making the same errors in new files.

We chose to do the ignores on a file basis as it is a perfect balance and it means that the tracking/graphing aspects of LintToTheFuture provide you with achievable goals, especially in large codebases.
